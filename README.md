# TOUR OF HEROES - I will be taking notes here

## NOTES

### STEP 0x0
- ```ng new app_name_here```
- ```ng-serve --open``` starts the local development server and --open flag signals to open in the browser at ```http://localhost:4200```. The page that you see is the application shell. The shell is controlled by the Angular component called AppComponent. Components are the building blocks of angular applications.
- When opening the src/app folder, the implementation of the shell AppComponent is distributed over three files: 1. ```app.component.ts``` which is the component class code and written in TypeScript 2. ```app.component.html``` which is the component template written in HTML 3. ```app.component.css``` which is the component's private CSS styles.

### STEP 0x1 The Hero Editor
- ```ng generate component heroes```
